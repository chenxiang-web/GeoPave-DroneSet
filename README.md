# Introduces the modules in DronePave-DfineX and the GeoPave-DroneSet dataset
GeoPave-DroneSet, a full-resolution pavement distress dataset bespoke to UAV inspections, annotated atop pristine images to encapsulate labyrinthine backgrounds and infrastructural holism, establishing a veridical, exigent benchmark for UAV-centric detection.
Here, only some partial images of the GeoPave-DroneSet are shown. The complete dataset will be released after acceptance.
