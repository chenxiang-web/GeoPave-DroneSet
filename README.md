# Introduces the modules in DronePave-DfineX and the GeoPave-DroneSet dataset
Introduces the Detail-Preserving Multi-Branch Downsampling (DP-MBD) and Adaptive Contextual Fusion Block (ACFB) in DronePave-DfineX.

GeoPave-DroneSet, a full-resolution pavement distress dataset bespoke to UAV inspections, annotated atop pristine images to encapsulate labyrinthine backgrounds and infrastructural holism, establishing a veridical, exigent benchmark for UAV-centric detection.

Here, only some partial images of the GeoPave-DroneSet are shown. The complete dataset will be released after acceptance.
